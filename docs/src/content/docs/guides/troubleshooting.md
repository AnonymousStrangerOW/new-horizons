## My slide reels aren't updating when I change them

Certain images (such as slide reels) get modified by New Horizons before usage, to save on resources NH will cache
the modified version of these images on the file system to be recalled later for easier access. If you are changing
an image you'll need to clear the cache located in the `SlideReelsCache` folder of your mod's directory to see changes. To do this simply delete the folder and restart the game.
